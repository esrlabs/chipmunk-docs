# Transition Journal

## Preliminary conclusion on the transition to a binary protocol

In the current version of chipmunk, data validation is performed:
- On the Rust side: through serialization/deserialization of data (serde), as well as part of the data being transferred to the JavaScript ecosystem as ready-made JavaScript objects.
- On the JavaScript side: received objects undergo additional validation from the ts-binding level to the client.

Thus, the current version already has validation tools that ensure the security of data transfer and processing. A comprehensive refactoring and transition to **protobuf** or **flatbuffer** seems unnecessary, as it would entail changing the entire communication chain between all components of the application (e.g., IPC (client â†” electron) would need to be completely updated). However, where necessary, the **MessagePack** protocol can be safely integrated, allowing the avoidance of unsafe JSON with minimal changes to the current codebase.

However, the next generation of chipmunk should initially adopt **protobuf** or **flatbuffer** as the base protocol, allowing for complete abandonment of "manual" data validation at all levels of the application.

## Stage 1

The `MessagePack` library turned out to be inapplicable at the TypeScript level. Without a data schema, this library does not allow recognizing incoming messages from Rust in TypeScript. Therefore, despite the fact that using `MessagePack` is extremely convenient at the Rust level, it cannot provide reliable results at higher levels, since TypeScript is not a strictly typed language.

Using `FlatBuffers`, on the other hand, is associated with the need to account for lifetime parameters when working with `FlatBuffers` messages at the Rust level. This is due to the peculiarities of `FlatBuffers`, which provides direct access to the data as soon as it is received. Thus, using `FlatBuffers` complicates the application.

However, comparing the performance of `FlatBuffers` and `Protobuf`, one can conclude that using `FlatBuffers` is justified in some cases and does indeed provide a performance boost. But the problem is that in `chipmunk`, there are simply no use cases where `FlatBuffers` performance would yield a noticeable and significant result.

Therefore, as a result of the first stage of protocol implementation, it was decided to use `Protobuf` as the main protocol.
